My contributions show how to fit the models he covered with Paul Bürkner’s brms package (Bürkner, 2017, 2018, 2020), which makes it easy to fit Bayesian regression models in R (R Core Team, 2020) using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. I also prefer plotting and data wrangling with the packages from the tidyverse (Wickham, 2019; Wickham et al., 2019). So we’ll be using those methods, too. ggformula This revision by Randall Pruim is aimed primarily at using ggformula for graphics. The main advantages of ggformula: a formula-based syntax (similar to what is used by {brms}); smoother compatibility with {tidyverse}; more consice code. In principle, anything that can be done with ggformula can be done with {ggplot2}, so this is a bit of syntactic sugar. But it is nice sugar. Additinonal things may be added/modified as well as I go along, including Not naming everything d. Simplifying code where possible. We have updates For a brief rundown of the version history, we have: Version 0.1.0. I released the 0.1.0 version of this project in November 24, 2020. It was the first full-length and nearly complete draft including material from all the 17 chapters in McElreath’s source material. All brms models were fit with version 2.14.0+. Version 0.1.1. Welcome to version 0.1.1! This is a mini update designed to fix code breaks resulting from updates to the broom package (Robinson &amp; Hayes, 2020), caught by Jenny Bigman; replace the soon-to-be retired sample_n() code with slice_sample(), caught by Randall Pruim; and correct a few typos along the way. Version 0.1.2 This is the first attempt at a ggformula conversion and is a work in progress. Progress will roughly parallel my Spring 2021 course.

Here’s the citation information: @book{kurzStatisticalRethinkingSecondEd2020, title = {Statistical {R}ethinking with brms, ggformula, and the tidyverse: {{Second}} edition}, author = {Kurz, A.

Some areas of the book could use some fleshing out. The sections I’m particularly anxious to improve are 4.6, which introduces the brms approach to b-splines; 15.3, which may someday include a brms workflow for categorical missing data; 16.2.3, which contains a mixture model that McElreath fit directly in Stan and I suspect may be possible in brms with a custom likelihood; and 16.4.2, which contains an ordinary differential equation model that McElreath fit directly in Stan and I suspect may be possible in brms, but is beyond my current skill set. If you have insights on how to improve any of these sections, please share your thoughts on GitHub at https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_with_brms_ggplot2_and_the_tidyverse_2_ed/issues.
