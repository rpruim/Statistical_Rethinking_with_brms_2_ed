<p>The posterior distribution is a probability distribution. And like all probability distributions, we can imagine drawing <em>samples</em> from it. The sampled events in this case are parameter values. Most parameters have no exact empirical realization. The Bayesian formalism treats parameter distributions as relative plausibility, not as any physical random process. In any event, randomness is always a property of information, never of the real world. But inside the computer, parameters are just as empirical as the outcome of a coin flip or a die toss or an agricultural experiment. The posterior defines the expected frequency that different parameter values will appear, once we start plucking parameters out of it. <span class="citation">(McElreath, <a href="#ref-mcelreathStatisticalRethinkingBayesian2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>, p. 50, <em>emphasis</em> in the original)</span></p>

Do note we’ve renamed his <code>prob_p</code> and <code>prob_data</code> as <code>prior</code> and <code>likelihood</code>, respectively.
Also, we have rescaled the prior and likelihood so that the sum of all the area under these curves
values is 1. This makes it easier to create plots comparing them.</p>

<p>Much like McElreath discussed in the <strong>Overthinking: Counting with <code>sum</code></strong> box, this works “because R internally converts a logical expression, like <code>samples &lt; 0.5</code>, to a vector of <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> results, one for each element of <code>samples</code>, saying whether or not each element matches the criterion” (p. 54). When we inserted that vector of <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code> values within the <code>mean()</code> function, they were then internally converted to a vector of 1’s and 0’s, the mean of which was the probability. Tricky!</p>
<p>Here are some additional (and arguably more natural) ways to do this taking advantage of functions in the <strong>mosaic</strong>
package.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Intervals of defined mass.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It is more common to see scientific journals reporting an interval of defined mass, usually known as a <strong>confidence interval</strong>. An interval of posterior probability, such as the ones we are working with, may instead be called a <strong>credible interval</strong>. We’re going to call it a <strong>compatibility interval</strong> instead, in order to avoid the unwarranted implications of “confidence” and “credibility.” What the interval indicates is a range of parameter values compatible with the model and data. The model and data themselves may not inspire confidence, in which case the interval will not either. (p. 54, <strong>emphasis</strong> in the original)</p>

<p>The <strong>tidyverse</strong> approach is nice in that that family of functions typically returns a data frame. But sometimes you just want your values in a numeric vector for the sake of quick indexing. In that case, base <strong>R</strong> <code>quantile()</code> shines.</p>

<p>Now’s a good time to introduce Matthew Kay’s <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-R-tidybayes" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a><a href="#ref-R-tidybayes" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span> <a href="https://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/"><strong>tidybayes</strong> package</a>, which offers an array of convenience functions for summarizing Bayesian models of the type we’ll be working with in this project. For all the <strong>brms</strong>-related details, see Kay’s <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kayExtractingVisualizingTidy2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a><a href="#ref-kayExtractingVisualizingTidy2020" role="doc-biblioref">b</a>)</span> vignette, <a href="https://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/articles/tidy-brms.html"><em>Extracting and visualizing tidy draws from brms models</em></a>. Here we start simple.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb69"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb69-1"><a href="sampling-the-imaginary.html#cb69-1"></a><span class="kw">library</span>(tidybayes)</span>

<pre><code>##       y  ymin  ymax .width .point .interval

<p>The <strong>tidybayes</strong> package contains a <a href="https://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/articles/tidy-brms.html#point-summaries-and-intervals">family of functions</a> that make it easy to summarize a distribution with a measure of central tendency accompanied by intervals. With <code>median_qi()</code>, we asked for the median and quantile-based intervals–just like we’ve been doing with <code>quantile()</code>. Note how the <code>.width</code> argument within <code>median_qi()</code> worked the same way the <code>prob</code> argument did within <code>rethinking::PI()</code>. With <code>.width = .5</code>, we indicated we wanted a quantile-based 50% interval, which was returned in the <code>ymin</code> and <code>ymax</code> columns. The tidybayes framework makes it easy to request multiple types of intervals. E.g., here we’ll request 50%, 80%, and 99% intervals.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb71"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb71-1"><a href="sampling-the-imaginary.html#cb71-1"></a><span class="kw">median_qi</span>(Samples3of3<span class="op">$</span>p, <span class="dt">.width =</span> <span class="kw">c</span>(.<span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="fl">.8</span>, <span class="fl">.99</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##       y     ymin  ymax .width .point .interval
## 1 0.843 0.709000 0.935   0.50 median        qi
## 2 0.843 0.570000 0.975   0.80 median        qi
## 3 0.843 0.260985 0.999   0.99 median        qi</code></pre>
<p>The <code>.width</code> column in the output indexed which line presented which interval. The value in the <code>y</code> column remained constant across rows. That’s because that column listed the measure of central tendency, the median in this case.</p>
<p>Now let’s use the <code>rethinking::HPDI()</code> function to return 50% highest posterior density intervals (HPDIs).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb73"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb73-1"><a href="sampling-the-imaginary.html#cb73-1"></a>rethinking<span class="op">::</span><span class="kw">HPDI</span>(Samples3of3<span class="op">$</span>p, <span class="dt">prob =</span> <span class="fl">.5</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##  |0.5  0.5| 
## 0.842 0.999</code></pre>
<p>The reason I introduce <strong>tidybayes</strong> now is that the functions of the <strong>brms</strong> package only support percentile-based intervals of the type we computed with <code>quantile()</code> and <code>median_qi()</code>. But <strong>tidybayes</strong> also supports HPDIs.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb75"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb75-1"><a href="sampling-the-imaginary.html#cb75-1"></a><span class="kw">mode_hdi</span>(Samples3of3<span class="op">$</span>p, <span class="dt">.width =</span> <span class="fl">.5</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##           y  ymin  ymax .width .point .interval
## 1 0.9562951 0.842 0.999    0.5   mode       hdi</code></pre>
<p>This time we used the mode as the measure of central tendency. With this family of <strong>tidybayes</strong> functions, you specify the measure of central tendency in the prefix (i.e., <code>mean</code>, <code>median</code>, or <code>mode</code>) and then the type of interval you’d like (i.e., <code>qi</code> or <code>hdi</code>).</p>
<p>If all you want are the intervals without the measure of central tendency or all that other technical information, tidybayes also offers the handy <code>qi()</code> and <code>hdi()</code> functions.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb77"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb77-1"><a href="sampling-the-imaginary.html#cb77-1"></a><span class="kw">qi</span>(Samples3of3<span class="op">$</span>p, <span class="dt">.width =</span> <span class="fl">.5</span>)</span></code></pre></div>

<pre><code>##       [,1]  [,2]
## [1,] 0.842 0.999</code></pre>
<p>These are nice in that they return simple numeric vectors, making them particularly useful to use as references within
plots. Now we have that skill, we can use it to make Figure 3.3.</p>

<p>In the <code>geom_ribbon()</code> line for the HPDI plot, did you notice how we replaced <code>d</code> with <code>.</code>? When using the pipe (i.e., <code>%&gt;%</code>), you can use the <code>.</code> as a placeholder for the original data object. It’s an odd and handy trick to know about. Go <a href="https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html">here</a> to learn more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the HPDI has some advantages over the PI. But in most cases, these two types of interval are very similar. They only look so different in this case because the posterior distribution is highly skewed. If we instead used samples from the posterior distribution for six waters in nine tosses, these intervals would be nearly identical. Try it for yourself, using different probability masses, such as <code>prob=0.8</code> and <code>prob=0.95</code>. When the posterior is bell shaped, it hardly matters which type of interval you use. (p. 57)</p>

<p>Let’s try it out.</p>

<p>We didn’t need that last <code>mutate_if()</code> line. It just made it easier to compare the <code>ymin</code> and <code>ymax</code> values. Anyway, McElreath was right. This time the differences between the HPDIs and QIs were trivial. Here’s a look at the posterior.</p>

<p>Be warned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The HPDI also has some disadvantages. HPDI is more computationally intensive than PI and suffers from greater <em>simulation variance</em>, which is a fancy way of saying that it is sensitive to how many samples you draw from the posterior. It is also harder to understand and many scientific audiences will not appreciate its features, while they will immediately understand a percentile interval, as ordinary non-Bayesian intervals are typically interpreted (incorrectly) as percentile intervals (pp. 57–58, <em>emphasis</em> in the original)</p>

<p>For convenience, we’ll primarily stick to the PI-based intervals in this ebook.</p>

<p>At the start of this section, McElreath poked a little at frequentist confidence intervals. For an introduction to confidence intervals from the perspective of a frequentist, you might check out Cumming’s <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-cummingNewStatisticsWhy2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797613504966"><em>The new statistics: Why and how</em></a> and the works referenced therein. Though their definition isn’t the most intuitive, I usually use confidence intervals when I wear my frequentist hat.</p>

<p>We’ve been calling point estimates measures of central tendency. If we <code>arrange()</code> our <code>d</code> tibble in descending order by <code>posterior</code>, we’ll see the corresponding <code>p</code> value for its MAP estimate.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be the proportion of the Earth covered by water and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> be our guess. If McElreath pays us $100 if we guess exactly right but subtracts money from the prize proportional to how far off we are, then our loss is proportional to <span class="math inline">\(d - p\)</span>.

<p>What McElreath did with <code>sapply()</code>, we’ll do with <code>purrr::map()</code>. If you haven’t used it, <code>map()</code> is part of a family of similarly-named functions (e.g., <code>map2()</code>) from the <a href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org"><strong>purrr</strong> package</a> <span class="citation">(Henry &amp; Wickham, <a href="#ref-R-purrr" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, which is itself part of the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org"><strong>tidyverse</strong></a>. The <code>map()</code> family is the <strong>tidyverse</strong> alternative to the family of <code>apply()</code> functions from the base <strong>R</strong> framework. You can learn more about how to use the <code>map()</code> family <a href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html">here</a> or <a href="https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls01_map-name-position-shortcuts.html">here</a> or <a href="https://data.library.virginia.edu/getting-started-with-the-purrr-package-in-r/">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Usually, research scientists don’t think about loss functions. And so any point estimate like the mean or MAP that they may report isn’t intended to support any particular decision, but rather to describe the shape of the posterior. You might argue that the decision to make is whether or not to accept an hypothesis. But the challenge then is to say what the relevant costs and benefits would be, in terms of the knowledge gained or lost. Usually it’s better to communicate as much as you can about the posterior distribution, as well as the data and the model itself, so that others can build upon your work. Premature decisions to accept or reject hypotheses can cost lives. (p. 61)</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2.2</span> Is the model adequate?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The implied predictions of the model are uncertain in two ways, and it’s important to be aware of both.</p>
<p>First, there is observation uncertainty. For any unique value of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, there is a unique implied pattern of observations that the model expects. These patterns of observations are the same gardens of forking data that you explored in the previous chapter. These patterns are also what you sampled in the previous section. There is uncertainty in the predicted observations, because even if you know <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> with certainty, you won’t know the next globe toss with certainty (unless <span class="math inline">\(p = 0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(p = 1\)</span>).</p>
<p>Second, there is uncertainty about <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. The posterior distribution over <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> embodies this uncertainty. And since there is uncertainty about <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, there is uncertainty about everything that depends upon <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. The uncertainty in <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> will interact with the sampling variation, when we try to assess what the model tells us about outcomes.</p>
<p>We’d like to <em>propagate</em> the parameter uncertainty–carry it forward–as we evaluate the implied predictions. All that is required is averaging over the posterior density for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, while computing the predictions. For each possible value of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, there is an implied distribution of outcomes. So if you were to compute the sampling distribution of outcomes at each value of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, then you could average all of these prediction distributions together, using the posterior probabilities of each value of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, to get a <strong>posterior predictive distribution</strong>.

<p>In Figure 3.7, McElreath considered the longest sequence of the sample values. We’ve been using <code>rbinom()</code> with the size parameter set to 9 for our simulations. E.g.,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb131"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb131-1"><a href="sampling-the-imaginary.html#cb131-1"></a><span class="kw">rbinom</span>(<span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dt">size =</span> <span class="dv">9</span>, <span class="dt">prob =</span> <span class="fl">.6</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##  [1] 7 5 6 8 7 5 6 3 3 4</code></pre>
<p>Notice this collapsed (i.e., aggregated) over the sequences within the individual sets of 9. What we need is to simulate nine individual trials many times over. For example, this</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb133"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb133-1"><a href="sampling-the-imaginary.html#cb133-1"></a><span class="kw">rbinom</span>(<span class="dv">9</span>, <span class="dt">size =</span> <span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dt">prob =</span> <span class="fl">.6</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0</code></pre>
<p>would be the disaggregated version of just one of the numerals returned by <code>rbinom()</code> when <code>size = 9</code>. So let’s try simulating again with un-aggregated samples. We’ll keep adding to our <code>samples</code> tibble. In addition to the disaggregated <code>draws</code> based on the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> values listed in <code>p</code>, we’ll also want to add a row index for each of those <code>p</code> values–it’ll come in handy when we plot.</p>

<p>As we’ll fully cover in the next chapter, <code>Estimate</code> is the posterior mean, the two <code>Q</code> columns are the quantile-based 95% intervals, and <code>Est.Error</code> is the posterior standard deviation.</p>
<p>Much like the way we used the <code>samples()</code> function to simulate probability values, above, we can do so with the <code>brms::fitted()</code> function. But we will have to specify <code>scale = "linear"</code> in order to return results in the probability metric. By default, <code>brms::fitted()</code> will return summary information. Since we want actual simulation draws, we’ll specify <code>summary = F</code>.</p>

<p>Looks a lot like the posterior probability density at the top of Figure 3.6, doesn’t it? Much like we did with <code>samples</code>, we can use this distribution of probabilities to predict histograms of <code>w</code> counts. With those in hand, we can make an analogue to the histogram in the bottom panel of Figure 3.6.</p>

<p>As you might imagine, we can use the output from <code>fitted()</code> to return disaggregated batches of 0’s and 1’s, too. And we could even use those disaggregated 0’s and 1’s to examine longest run lengths and numbers of switches as in the analyses for Figure 3.7. I’ll leave those as exercises for the interested reader.</p>
